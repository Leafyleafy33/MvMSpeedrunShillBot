# Shroomer Shill Station 300k

I created the Shroomer Shill Station 300k for [Mushroom hunting](https://www.youtube.com/@Mushroomhunting1337) as a practical (joke) solution for analyzing and displaying speedrun data for the Potato.tf MvM community, and generating wild descriptions for videos He archives. This is my first application built on the Streamlit framework, so it was fun to experiment with. 

## Key Features

- **Speedrun Record Search**: Automates the gathering and organization of speedrunning records from the [Potato.tf](https://potato.tf/speedruns) website, and the steam profiles of players. Outputs markdown prompt for each record found with variety of information.
- **Rankings Dashboard**: Offers clear, interactive displays of player rankings and steam profiles, currently searchable by top 10, 20, and 50 players.
- **Automated Prompt Generation**: Pure shill-tier high-energy nonsense, but quite humorous. Made so that one could change the system prompt themes and programatically generate descriptions for recorded videos if so desired.

## Use Cases

- **Speedrun Analysis**: Enables players and enthusiasts to scrutinize world record runs and player statistics.
- **Community Engagement**: Assists in generating prompts for video description, quite useful for a good laugh. 

All the best, and happy hunting!
